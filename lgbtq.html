<div class="article-text">

<p>  Living or having been to Africa, one can agree that there are pressing issues that need attention rather than wasting precious time on agendas that do not benefit Africa.
    According to research conducted by various organizations, 80% of families in Africa survive on one dollar per day.
     Unfortunately, 40% of children are out of school due to financial constraints, and youth are being recruited into criminal activities.
    
    <br> <br>
    
    However, instead of addressing these issues, the Western world wants Africa to focus on sexual immorality.
     We, as Africans, have far more important things to concentrate on than what the West wants us to think about. 
     The Western world needs to stop imposing their values on us and being hypocritical.
    
     <br> <br>
    
   <b> If Our Leaders truly cares about Africa, they should take the following actions:</b>
    
   <br> <br>
    
   <b>Visa-free access: </b>
    
    Africans should be able to travel to any Western country without fear and high costs of visa processing. They should also have the right to live in any Western country for as long as they want.

    <br> <br>
    <b>Reparations for the slave trade: </b>
    
    Every Western nation that was involved in the slave trade in Africa needs to publicly apologize and return valuable artifacts and resources they stole from Africa.

    <br> <br>
    <b>Terrorism: </b>
    
    Since they are privileged to have sophisticated weapons and ammunition, they should assist Africa in ending terrorism.
    Our leaders also need to do better than they have done so far in the following aspect;
    <br> <br>
   <b> Medical sector: </b>
    
    It’s so shameful that after over 60 years of being free, our leaders still travel overseas to get treatment. Why exactly can’t we build what we enjoy oversea in our own motherland?              
    60% of medical practitioners have traveled to seek greener pastures, is this not enough to worry about?
    <br> <br>
   <b> Unemployment:</b>
    
    Our leaders need to focus on creating a good atmosphere for investors to come into the system and create more job opportunities.
    These are a few out of many other things our leaders need to conquer before paying attention to an agenda that will do Africa no good.
    
    <br> <br>
    It is time to prioritize the critical issues that affect the well-being of our people. Let us work together to bring about meaningful change in our communities.
