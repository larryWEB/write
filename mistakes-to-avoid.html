<p> As a newcomer in the tech industry, it's understandable that you're filled with excitement and enthusiasm. You can't wait to hit the ground running, delve into learning, and work on amazing projects. 

<br>

    However, in order to make your journey more fruitful, there are certain pitfalls you should be aware of and avoid. Let's take a look at some of the common mistakes to steer clear of as a newbie in tech.
    
    </p>

<br> <br> 

<h1> 1. Prioritizing Money Above All Else:</h1>

<br> <br>
    <p>  If your main motivation for pursuing a career in tech is solely monetary, it's important to reconsider your mindset or perhaps even your chosen path. Without genuine passion and excitement for what you're learning, burnout is likely to be just around the corner. 
    
    <br> <br>
    
    While it's true that the tech industry offers great financial opportunities, they won't come without effort. You'll need to work on numerous unpaid personal projects to showcase your skills before reaching the stage of financial success.
    
    <br> <br>
    
    Gaining relevant experience often requires taking up free internships or volunteering. If you're not willing to put in this effort, it becomes difficult to expect monetary rewards.
    
    <br> <br>
    
    Remember, fall in love with the work you do, and the financial rewards will naturally follow.</p>

<br><br>


<h1> 2. Don't Specialize Without Exploring Various Fields:</h1>

<br> <br>
    <p>  You may have a specific tech field in mind that you believe suits you perfectly. However, it's important to
         recognize that our initial instincts aren't always accurate. You won't know what truly resonates with you until you explore different areas.
    
    <br> <br>
    
    Consider the example of someone who starts as a web developer but later finds their passion lies in data analysis. Or someone who begins as a graphics designer, 
    only to discover their calling in UI/UX design or web development.
    
    <br> <br>
    
  
By not giving other fields a try, you risk limiting your own growth and missing out on potential opportunities. 
Many people leave the tech industry because, after several years, they no longer find joy in what they do and feel trapped.
 Avoid this by taking various courses, understanding the fundamentals, and embracing the fact that every skill you learn is transferable.
</p>
    <br> <br>
  

<br>


<h1> 3. YouTube vs. Paid Courses: </h1>

<br> <br>
    <p>  Personally, I have benefited from YouTube as a valuable learning resource, and I can confidently say that it's a great platform for acquiring knowledge. 
    
    <br> <br>
    
    However, it's essential to recognize that YouTube videos lack a structured curriculum or clear learning path. 
    As a beginner, it's easy to get overwhelmed and not know where to start or what to prioritize.
    
    <br> <br>
    
  

    This is where the advantage of paid courses becomes apparent. Developed by professionals in your desired field, 
    these courses provide structured guidance and a step-by-step approach. Platforms like Coursera offer assignments to test your understanding and often conclude with a capstone project. 
    Investing in paid courses creates accountability, as your financial commitment motivates you to complete the course. 

    <br> <br>
    Unlike YouTube, where you can easily abandon videos without consequences, paid courses keep you on track.
