<p>  It deeply saddens me to witness the misconceptions and negative reactions people have towards those who engage in public evangelism.
     It is disheartening to witness the displayed ignorance, and it leaves me with a sense of disappointment.
    
<br><br>
    One prevailing misconception is that individuals involved in public evangelism are jobless or lazy. Many assume that it is their lack of employment that drives them to roam the streets, preaching the gospel of Christ.
    
    <br><br>
    
    I personally encountered this stereotype about a year ago. While actively spreading the message of Christ with my friend, an elderly man approached us and advised us to learn a skill. Little did he know that my friend and I were skilled professionals in one of the most sought-after fields—software development.
    
    <br><br>
    
    The truth is that while we can pursue and aspire to great heights in our careers, they will all fade away. It might surprise you to know that God does not require your engineering or business expertise in heaven.
    
    <br><br>
    
    Regrettably, the only work that is truly recognized and will withstand the test of time is the work of an evangelist. It took me some time to accept this harsh reality.
    
    <br><br>
    
    However, this does not mean you should abandon your ambitions. In your pursuit of success, it is crucial not to lose sight of the ultimate goal on Earth: winning souls for God's kingdom and reducing the population of hell.
    
    
    <br><br>
     Now that I have made my point clear, I urge you to change your mindset. Instead of looking down on those to whom this spiritual mystery has been revealed, it would be beneficial for you to pray for the grace to boldly spread the Good News.
     <br><br>
    
    
    But what if my work leaves me with no spare time to reach out to souls?
    
    <br><br>
    
    You do not have to resign; your workplace is another platform to share the goodness of Christ. Let everyone around you see the light of Christ in your life. In fact, you don't even need to speak to minister—your actions speak louder.
    
    <br><br>
    
    Take advantage of every opportunity you have to tell people about Christ, and you will not regret it. Not all of us need to be on the streets; you can do it wherever you find yourself, directly through preaching or indirectly through your lifestyle.
    
    <br><br>
    
    Lastly, when you encounter someone publicly declaring God's goodness, show them love. Remind yourself that they are not hungry or unemployed. They are willing souls completely devoted to Christ, and their job does not hinder their calling.
    
    Shalom.
