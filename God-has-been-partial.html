    Before we begin, I humbly ask you to approach this article with an open heart and mind, considering each word with empathy and understanding until the end.
   Allow me to transport you back in time, to the period following God's creation of heaven and earth. 
   <br><br>
   Prior to the creation of humanity, the devil committed an offense against Him, resulting in his expulsion from heaven, along with his followers.
   <br><br>

   <b>Now, one might question:</b>
    <br><br>
     Why didn't God forgive the devil?  After all, didn't He command us to forgive those who offend us? 
    It appears as though God does not practice what He preaches.
    
    
    <br><br>
    But before we draw any conclusions, let us delve deeper.
    
    <br><br>
    
    Why did God choose to appear solely to Noah, informing him of His intentions to cleanse the earth with water?
     Could it be that if God had manifested Himself to others in the same manner as He did to Noah, many more would have repented? Is this equitable?
     <br><br>
   One might think that God would have learned His lesson, yet history shows a similar occurrence during the time of Abraham.
    He destroyed Sodom, sparing Lot and his family, although Lot's wife tragically perished. 
    Does this imply that God loved Lot and his household more than any other beings residing in Sodom at that time?
    
    <br><br>
    
    Furthermore, this same God rejected Esau, a baby without sin, while favoring his twin brother, Jacob.
     What reasoning can be given for such an act? Wasn't God the one who created both of them?
    
     <br><br>
    
    Consider the people of Egypt, God killed their firstborn children, decimated their farmlands with locusts, and destroyed their chariots in the sea.
     Innocent individuals paid the price for the stubbornness of their king. What exactly was God trying to prove here?
    
     <br><br>
    
    After employing Moses for numerous years and stripping him of all the comforts he once enjoyed in the king's palace,
     God ultimately denied him entry into the promised landâ€”the very same land He had used as a lure to entice Moses.
      Despite Moses' repeated pleas, God rejected them. What kind of wickedness is this?
    
 <br><br>

    Moreover, Stephen, a devoted servant, was stoned to death, and the best recompense God offered was to commission the very man who orchestrated Stephen's demise
     to preach the same gospel for which Stephen was killed. Can this be deemed fair?
    
     <br><br>
    
    Based on everything you have read thus far, it may seem reasonable to conclude that God has displayed partiality and injustice. 
    But, if you agree, please continue reading, as I have more to share.
    
    
    <br><br>

   <b> Now, allow me to pose a few questions:</b>
    
   <br><br>
    
    Why does God make it rain upon both believers and unbelievers?
    
    <br><br>
  Why does He illuminate the path for both the wicked and the righteous?
    <br><br>
    
    Were you present when He created heaven and earth?
    
    <br><br>
    If He chooses to reclaim His breath, can you prevent Him from doing so?
    
    <br><br>
    Do you possess greater knowledge than the One who created knowledge itself?
    
    <br><br>
    Who can declare a matter, and without God's consent, see it come to fruition?
    
    <br><br>
    The sad truth is that there are numerous aspects of existence that lie beyond our comprehension.
    <br><br>
    God is God!
    
    <br><br>
    
    His ways are distinct from ours, and we must learn to trust Him even when we struggle to comprehend Him fully.
    He is deserving of our trust, and He cares deeply for each and every one of us.
    <br><br>
   <b> GOD HAS NEVER BEEN PARTIAL; HIS WAYS ARE ROOTED IN JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS.</b>
   <br><br>
    May peace be with you as you continue your journey of faith and understanding.
